Vectora ships with **160+ native tools**, organized by category. The philosophy is "batteries included": whatever is high-frequency and broadly useful comes built in, instead of requiring a separate MCP server install for everything.

| Category          | Tools                                                                                                         |

| **GitHub**        | `gh_issue_create/list/view/comment`, `gh_pr_create/list/view/merge` (via the `gh` CLI)                        |
| **Web**           | `web_search`, `web_fetch` + extraction/crawl                                                                  |

| **Memory**        | `save_memory`, `get_memory`, `delete_memory`                                                                  |
| **Workspace**     | `workspace_list`, `workspace_describe`, `bucket_summary`                                                      |
| **Integrations**  | Jira, Slack, Linear, Google Drive, Gmail, Notion (optional, via OAuth/API key per workspace)                  |
| **Utility**       | `time_*`, `hash_*`, `base64_*`, `regex_test`, `json_query`, `jwt_decode`, `http_request`                      |
| **MCP**           | `call_mcp_tool` — delegates to third-party MCP servers configured by the user                                 |

## Enabling/disabling tools

Administrators control which tools are available to each user in **Settings → Administration → Tools**. Each third-party MCP plugin has its own **Tool Policy** panel (in **Settings → Environment → Plugins**) for per-server granularity.

## Defensiveness

Every tool has internal error handling — a tool failure never crashes the conversation; it becomes an error observation that the agent itself sees and can react to (retry, notify you, choose another path).

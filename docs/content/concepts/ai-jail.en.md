AI Jail is Vectora's sandbox for the agent's terminal and filesystem access. It follows the original [ai-jail](https://github.com/akitaonrails/ai-jail) idea — the agent's actions run *inside* the jail, not behind a single sandboxed function call — adapted to Vectora's architecture: a single long-running backend process serving many concurrent workspaces, rather than one process per invocation.

## Threat model

Without a sandbox, `terminal`, `file_write`, and `file_edit` operate directly in the backend process — the agent (or a prompt injection) can read `~/.ssh`, exfiltrate secrets, or run destructive commands with the same privileges as the backend itself. AI Jail exists to bound that blast radius to a workspace's declared `rw_paths`/`ro_paths`, without giving up file and terminal access entirely (that would defeat the point of an autonomous coding agent).

## Opt-in, per workspace

AI Jail is **off by default**. It activates only when a workspace's `vectora.toml` has a `[sandbox]` section:

```toml
[sandbox]
enabled = true
backend = "local"          # local (bwrap, Linux) | docker | ssh | modal
rw_paths = ["."]           # writable inside the jail
ro_paths = []               # read-only inside the jail
mask = [".env", "**/*.pem", "**/.ssh/**", "**/.aws/**"]
no_gpu = true
lockdown = false            # true: fail-closed on any policy ambiguity
```

No `[sandbox]` section → the workspace behaves exactly as before this feature existed. Malformed TOML or an invalid field, once `[sandbox]` is present, fails **closed** (locked down) instead of silently running unprotected.

## How it works: one worker per workspace

Instead of spawning a new sandboxed process for every tool call, Vectora keeps a single persistent jailed worker process alive per workspace with `[sandbox]` enabled — born on the first sandboxable action, killed when the workspace goes idle. `file_write`, `file_edit`, and one-shot `terminal` commands route through this worker via a small JSON-lines protocol (`exec`/`read_file`/`write_file`).

On the `local` backend (Linux only), the worker runs under `bwrap` (Bubblewrap) with:

- Filesystem namespacing restricted to `rw_paths`/`ro_paths`.
- Masked paths (`mask`) never exposed inside the jail, even if they fall under an allowed path.
- A real seccomp-BPF filter (via `libseccomp`) denying a fixed list of dangerous syscalls (`ptrace`, `mount`, `unshare`, `bpf`, kernel module loading, etc.) — if `libseccomp` isn't installed on the host, the worker still runs under namespace isolation, just without the syscall filter, and this degradation is logged.

Other backends (`docker`, `ssh`, `modal`) run the same worker model against their respective isolation primitive; `docker` additionally denies network access under `lockdown`.

## Known limitation: interactive terminal

The one-shot `terminal` tool call and file tools are sandboxed today. An **interactive** terminal session (the Terminal tab, PTY-backed) is not yet routed through the jailed worker — starting an interactive terminal on a sandboxed workspace returns a clear error rather than silently falling back to an unsandboxed shell. This is scoped for a future iteration.
